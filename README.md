# DappBoilerplate

Boilerplate that contains everything you need to start your Dapp! React, Redux, Webpack, Forms, Modals, Tooltips, you name it!

## Development

to install all modules run ```yarn```

to start dev server on localhost:8080 run ```yarn dev-server```

to start server with production build on localhost:8080 run ```yarn prod-server```

to build production files run ```yarn prod```. Production code will be generated in the /dist directory

if you want to run any of these commands without eslint run them with the addition of ```-no-lint``` example: ```yarn dev-server-no-lint```

### Truffle

The truffle framework is included with this boilerplate. See all Truffle commands [here](http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/commands)
